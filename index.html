        <p class="donate-describe">Our beloved country Bangladesh is facing a devastating flood while suffering from the
            COVID pandemic and is
            in urgent need of our help. Close to oneg-third of Bangladesh is underwater, Forecasts predict that the
            country will experience worse flooding in the coming days. Already, more than 2.8 million people have been
            affected, including over 1 million who remain isolated and surrounded by floodwaters, according to the
            Bangladesh Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief.</p>

        <p class="donate-describe">The Bangladesh Government continues to mobilize resources to support the affected
            communities, such as basic food, water purification tablets, and cash grants. However, further support from
            charitable organizations and development partners is still desperately needed. Due to the power outage and
            the shortage of safe drinking water, many city-dwellers are buying bottled water at increased prices. The
            need for rescue and relief intensifies as days pass in the flood-affected areas. Many parts remain
            unreachable due to the high tide of floodwater and the shortages of vessels. A coordinated humanitarian
            response will greatly complement Government’s efforts to ensure that the most vulnerable communities receive
            targeted humanitarian assistance. </p>

                <h2>Education for a child</h2>
                <p class="describe">Children, who make up about 40 percent of the population of the country of more than
                    160 million, are paying a particularly high price in the move, researchers say.

                    Most Bangladeshi children not attending primary school live in urban slums, or in hard-to-reach or
                    disaster-prone areas, according to UNICEF.

                    About 1.7 million children in the country are labourers, one in four of them 11 years old or
                    younger, the agency’s research shows. Girls, who often work as domestic labourers, rarely even show
                    up in the statistics, UNICEF noted. <a target="_blank"

            <p class="unicef-describe">Four million people, including 1.6 million children, stranded by flash floods in
                north-eastern Bangladesh are in urgent need of help. UNICEF is on the ground to protect children and to
                deliver emergency water and health supplies.

                “Children need safe drinking water right now. Preventing deadly waterborne diseases is one of several
                critical concerns,” said Mr. Sheldon Yett, UNICEF Representative to Bangladesh

                UNICEF has already dispatched 400,000 water purification tablets that can support 80,000 households with
                clean water for a week. UNICEF is working to further support the Government of Bangladesh’s emergency
                response with millions of water purification tablets, more than 10,000 water containers known as jerry
                cans, and thousands of hygiene kits for women and adolescent girls. UNICEF is also procuring emergency
                medicines supplies for district health facilities.<a target="_blank"
